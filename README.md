**Description**

This lightweight extension allows changing the window title of Visual Studio to include a folder tree with a configurable min depth and max depth distance from the solution/project file, and the use of special tags to help with many other possible scenarios (Git, Mercurial, TFS...). 

Solution-specific overriding rules are available as well to cover virtually any possible renaming needs.

It can also be configured so that the rules apply only when at least two instances of Visual Studio are running with the same window title.

**Documentation**

Full documentation is available on the [Visual Studio Gallery page](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/f3f23845-5b1e-4811-882f-60b7181fa6d6).

**Supported editions**

Visual Studio 2010, 2012, 2013, 2015+.
